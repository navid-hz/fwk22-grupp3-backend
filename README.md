# Blog Server

Welcome to the Blog Server! This server provides endpoints for managing a simple blog system.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the server up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

npm install

### Authentification

Before starting the server, you need to configure the MongoDB connection by adding valid authentication credentials to a .env file in the project root directory.

### Starting Server

npm start

### Starting Server with nodemon

npm run server

### Connet to database

add .env file in root and your database connection in it

The server will start, and you should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running and listening on a specific port (e.g., Server is running on port 5000).
